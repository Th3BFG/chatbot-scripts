# Emote Handler
Emote Handler for the Streamlabs Chatbot

Allows a Streamer to configure Emotes for their Streamlabs Chatbot to respond to.
Currently, the bot will respond with the configured emote.
I would eventually like to allow for custome responses.

Bot comes with a configurable cooldown to prevent spam. Cooldown is applied per emote, per user.
