# Emote Handler
Emote Handler for the [Streamlabs Chatbot](https://streamlabs.com/chatbot)

Allows a Streamer to configure Emotes for their Chatbot to respond to.
By default, the Chatbot will respond with the same Emote.
To configure a custom response, add a colon (:) after the Emote, then the response.
Separate each Emote entry with a semicolon (;).

Example Dictionary:
Kreygasm; FeelsBadMan:FeelsGoodMan; SeemsGood

The script comes with a configurable cooldown to prevent spam. 
Cooldown is applied per Emote, per user. Default Cooldown is 3 minutes.
